=head2 What kind of name is Paxton?

So this is largely inspired by the Jackson Java library, so
I was looking for a name similar to that, but distinct. The
Python port is called (wait for it), Pyckson and the Ruby
port is called Rackson, so for sure I didn't want to call it
Perkson, but Packson kind of worked. Then I remembered that
Bill Paxton died recently and since I grew watching his
movies I figured, why not!
